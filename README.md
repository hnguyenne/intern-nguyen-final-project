## Summary of Service
This is a modular backend system designed to handle various business operations, including user management, insights, quotes, offers, and plans. It leverages a microservices architecture with event-driven communication and role-based access control (RBAC). Each module is implemented as a standalone service with clear responsibilities and APIs.

### Key Features:
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and workspace association.
- **Insights**: Allows users to create and retrieve workspace-specific insights.
- **Quotes and Offers**: Manages the lifecycle of quotes and offers, including tracking conversions.
- **Plans**: Enables the creation and retrieval of workspace-specific plans.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses an event emitter to facilitate communication between services.

## Scope and RLS Logic
### Scope
The service is designed to support multi-tenant applications with the following scopes:
- **User Management**: Authentication and workspace association.
- **Insights**: CRUD operations for workspace-specific insights.
- **Quotes and Offers**: Quote generation, conversion tracking, and offer creation.
- **Plans**: Workspace-specific plan management.

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Logic
The service enforces row-level security by associating all data with a `workspace_id`. This ensures that users can only access data belonging to their assigned workspace. Key RLS mechanisms include:
1. **Workspace Association**:
   - Users are associated with a specific workspace upon login or via explicit assignment.
   - Example: `SELECT current_setting('app.workspace_id', true)` is used to retrieve the current workspace context.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Permissions are extracted from the token and validated against the required actions.
   - Example: `read:insight` for retrieving insights, `write:insight` for creating insights.

## Event Emission Explained
The service uses an event-driven architecture powered by an `EventEmitter` to facilitate communication between modules. Events are emitted using the `publishEvent` function, and subscribers listen for specific topics to process these events.

### Example: Insight Creation
1. **Event Emission**:
   - The `createInsight` API emits an event with the topic `"Insight.New"`:
     ```typescript
     publishEvent("Insight.New", { id, workspaceId, data });
     ```
2. **Event Subscription**:
   - A subscriber listens for the `"Insight.New"` topic and processes the event:
     ```typescript
     snsEmitter.on("Insight.New", async (message) => {
         console.log(`Subscriber received Insight.New event:`, message);
         // Process the event (e.g., log to ClickHouse)
     });
     ```
3. **Use Cases**:
   - Logging events to ClickHouse for analytics.
   - Triggering downstream workflows, such as notifications or data synchronization.

### Other Events:
- **`lead.new`**: Emitted when a new lead is created.
- **`quote.sent`**: Emitted when a quote is sent.
- **`quote.conversion`**: Emitted when a quote is converted (accepted/rejected).

## What Youâ€™d Improve in v2
### 1. **Centralized Event Management**
   - Implement a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to replace the in-memory `EventEmitter`. This would improve scalability and reliability in distributed environments.

### 2. **Enhanced Permission Handling**
   - Refactor permission handling to support hierarchical permissions and dynamic resource-based access control (RBAC).
   - Example: Allow permissions like `read:resource` to be scoped to specific resources (e.g., `workspaceId`).

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Standardize error handling across all APIs with consistent error codes and messages.
   - Example: Use a middleware to catch and format errors before sending responses.

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Add unit and integration tests for all APIs and event subscribers to ensure reliability.
   - Example: Mock the `snsEmitter` and database interactions for isolated testing.

### 5. **API Documentation**
   - Generate OpenAPI specifications for all APIs to improve developer experience and integration.

### 6. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track API performance and event processing metrics.
